A recursive function is a function that calls itself.
A recursive computation solves a problem by using
the solution to the same problem with simpler inputs.


There are two key requirements to make sure that the
recursion is successful:
• Every recursive call must simplify the task in some
way.
• There must be special cases to handle the simplest
tasks directly.

-----------Case of printTriangle Function----------- 

[]
[][]
[][][]
[][][][]
[][][][][]

def printTriangle(sideLength) :
    if sideLength < 1 : return
    printTriangle(sideLength - 1)
    print("[]" * sideLength)

Look at the printTriangle function one more time and
notice how utterly reasonable it is. If the side length is
0, nothing needs to be printed. The next part is just as
reasonable. Print the smaller triangle and don’t think
about why that works. Then print a row of []. Clearly,
the result is a triangle of the desired size.
