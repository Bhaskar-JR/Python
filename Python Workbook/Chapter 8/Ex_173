Ex_173. Write a program that reads values from the user until a blank line is entered. 
Display the total of all of the values entered by the user (or 0.0 if the first value
entered is a blank line). Complete this task using recursion. Your program may not use 
any loops.

Hint: The body of your recursive function will need to read one value from the
user, and then determine whether or not to make a recursive call. Your function
does not need to take any arguments, but it will need to return a numeric result.


def readAndTotal():
# Read a value from the user
line = input("Enter a number (blank to quit): ")
# Base case: The user entered a blank line so the total is 0
if line == "":
    return 0
else:
    # Recursive case: Convert the current line to a number and use recursion to read the
    # subsequent lines
    return float(line) + readAndTotal()

# Read a collection of numbers from the user and display the total
def main():
    # Read the values from the user and compute the total
    total = readAndTotal()
    # Display the total
    print("The total of all those values is", total)

# Call the main function
main()
